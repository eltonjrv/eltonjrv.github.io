# Customized RDP reference database
The original fasta file was downloaded from http://drive5.com/sintax/rdp_16s_v16_sp.fa.gz

Then, after uncompressing with "gunzip" command, in order to create our customized rdp_16s_extra_seqs.fa file, we appended 16S rRNA sequences from the following species: 

>*Ehrlichia canis* and *Ehrlichia chaffeensis*

>*Anaplasma platys* and *Anaplasma phagocytophilum*

>*Mycoplasma haemocanis* and *Mycoplasma haematoparvum*

Those are vector-borne pathogens of interest in Vet Med that were missing at the original RDP file from Robert Edgar (Uparse developer). Those sequences are exactly the same as inserted in our positive control plasmids for the multi-infection simulations. Please see Methods section ("Positive controls and standard curves" subsection) for details and their respective GenBank accesssion numbers ([Vasconcelos et al., 2021 - BMC Vet.Res.](https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-021-02969-9)). M. haematoparvum sequence is derived from GenBank AY383241.1.
